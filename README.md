## Features

- **Signal-based reactivity** — Per-property signals; only bindings that depend on changed state re-run.
- **Component intent signals** — Typed one-shot actions like save, refresh, or mode change, kept separate from render state.
- **No virtual DOM** — Direct subscriptions update text nodes and attributes in place.
- **Two authoring styles** — Inline `@Pick` for compact components; class-based `@PickRender` for explicit structure.
- **Built-in UI primitives** — `<pick-for>`, `<pick-select>`, `<pick-action>`, `<pick-link>`, and `<pick-router>` cover lists, branching, actions, and navigation.
- **Native slot projection** — Named and default `<slot>` elements for composable layouts via Shadow DOM.
- **Factory-first DI** — Explicit dependency injection through factory functions; no hidden service construction.
- **Security-first expression evaluator** — Deterministic AST pipeline; no `eval` or `new Function`. Whitelisted read-only method calls only.
- **SEO-friendly prerender adoption** — HTML-first delivery with compatible prerendered markup adopted on the client.
- **Tiny footprint** — Zero runtime dependencies.
- **Browser-ready ESM releases** — GitHub release artifacts can be loaded directly with `<script type="module">`.

## Why Pick Components Exists

Web frontend is not my full-time work. But every now and then I end up building something for the web — a personal project, something small, or a tool for a friend — and every time I step into that world I get the same feeling: too many layers, too many frameworks, too many libraries piled on top of each other, and not enough sense that I can still see the project from the ground up. At some point, it starts to feel like something is off.

Pick Components came from that feeling. It did not come from “I want to build another framework”, and it definitely did not come from any desire to compete with React, Angular, or Vue. It came from wanting something useful for my own needs: a way to build native Web Components with clearer boundaries, controlled templates, and less dependence on large runtimes.

This idea is older than this repository. More than five years ago, in `FieldDocumentMaker`, inside `FieldDocumentMaker.Editor/src/components`, I had a base component that already contained the first rough shape of this idea. One intuition from that code never really left me: in JavaScript, `a.b` and `a["b"]` are just two ways of reaching the same property. That changed how I thought about UI. Less “just run code here”, more “resolve this from structure”.

That old component already had early versions of ideas that later became central to this project: `{{...}}` template bindings, property-based bindings, reactive DOM updates, and a small DOM/template compilation step. What it still lacked was a cleaner architecture and a harder line around what templates were allowed to do.

Over time, that became a design rule. I wanted expressions in templates, but I did not want `eval`, `new Function`, or arbitrary JavaScript running inside templates. That decision pushed the project toward parsing a limited expression language, building an AST, and evaluating it under explicit rules. A lot of what Pick Components is today comes from taking that idea seriously instead of treating templates as a place where anything goes.

Language models helped a lot while building this. Not just as code generators — which they also were, thank God — but for exploring architecture, testing ideas, refactoring, formalizing vague intuitions, and speeding up implementation and documentation. The direction still had to come from me, but they made it much easier to iterate on the design of the framework.

That is why I built Pick Components: to build native Web Components with a more explicit internal architecture, controlled templates, reactive state, a clear lifecycle, and less dependence on large runtimes. If that sounds useful, try it, read the code, question the design, open issues, and contribute if you want to help shape it.

## Installation

```bash
npm install pick-components
```

## Copilot AI Setup (Optional)

If you want Copilot to follow Pick Components conventions (components, DI, tests, and templates), install the workspace skill into your project:

```bash
npx --package=pick-components pick-components-copilot
```

This copies `.github/skills/setup-pick-components/` into your project root. Commit the result to enable the skill for your whole team.

To install into a specific directory:

```bash
npx --package=pick-components pick-components-copilot --target /path/to/your-project
```

Once installed, type `/setup-pick-components` in Copilot chat to activate the skill.

---

## Choose Your Setup

### Option A — npm + bundler

Use this in Vite, Rollup, Webpack, esbuild, or similar toolchains.

```typescript
import { bootstrapFramework, Services } from "pick-components";
```

This path does not specifically require Vite, but it does require a toolchain that can resolve npm package imports for the browser.

### Option B — plain HTML + browser-ready ESM

Use this when you want to import the framework directly in the browser with no bundler.

For this mode, use the browser-ready artifacts prepared for GitHub Releases rather than trying to import the npm package directly in the browser.

Release assets are published here:

- `https://github.com/pick-components/pick-components/releases`
- `https://github.com/pick-components/pick-components/releases/tag/v<version>`

Direct asset URLs follow this pattern:

- `https://github.com/pick-components/pick-components/releases/download/v<version>/pick-components.js`
- `https://github.com/pick-components/pick-components/releases/download/v<version>/pick-components-bootstrap.js`

Recommended flow:

1. Download the browser bundle from the project's GitHub Release assets.
2. Copy it into your site's public assets, for example `/vendor/pick-components.js`.
3. Write your component source in TypeScript or modern JavaScript.
4. Transpile it before serving it to the browser.
5. Import the generated JavaScript from your HTML with `<script type="module">`.

Minimal HTML:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <body>
    <hello-card></hello-card>
    <script type="module" src="./hello-card.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Minimal TypeScript source:

```typescript
import {
  bootstrapFramework,
  Services,
  Pick,
} from "/vendor/pick-components.js";

await bootstrapFramework(Services);

@Pick("hello-card", (ctx) => {
  ctx.state({ name: "world" });
  ctx.html(`<p>Hello {{name}}</p>`);
})
class HelloCard {}
```

The browser-ready distribution is self-contained and does not rely on external runtime packages or Node builtins. It is intended for direct browser import once the file is being served by your site.

The npm package is optimized for development and consumption. The plain-browser distribution is documented and prepared as a separate release artifact flow, not as a browser-importable npm package entrypoint.

For GitHub Releases, the project also prepares a heavier browser distribution with:

- non-minified bundles
- minified bundles
- source maps for all browser bundles
- SHA256 checksums

Build the release artifacts locally with:

```bash
npm run build:release
```

This creates `.release-artifacts/v<version>/`, which mirrors the intended GitHub Release contents.

This direct browser path assumes a modern browser environment with ESM. TypeScript syntax and decorators must still be transpiled unless your target runtime explicitly supports the exact JavaScript decorator syntax you are serving.

---

## TypeScript And Decorators

Pick Components works with both TypeScript decorator emits:

- Standard decorators: `experimentalDecorators` omitted or `false`.
- Legacy decorators: `experimentalDecorators: true`.

You should not need to change a Vite/TypeScript project just to use Pick Components. The default bootstrap accepts both modes.

Recommended public syntax:

```typescript
class Counter extends PickComponent {
  @Reactive count = 0;
}
```

`@Reactive accessor count = 0` is still supported for users who explicitly want TC39 auto-accessors, but it is not required.

The playground and downloaded examples transpile with this compiler shape:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "experimentalDecorators": false
  }
}
```

If your project uses TypeScript's `experimentalDecorators` pipeline, the default bootstrap already supports it:

```typescript
await bootstrapFramework(Services);
```

Strict decorator mode is available only when you intentionally want to accept TC39 standard decorators only:

```typescript
await bootstrapFramework(Services, {}, { decorators: "strict" });
```

---

## Bootstrap

Call `bootstrapFramework()` once in your entry point before component modules that use `@Pick`, `@PickRender`, `@Reactive`, or `@Listen` are evaluated:

```typescript
import { bootstrapFramework, Services } from "pick-components";

await bootstrapFramework(Services);
await import("./my-component.js");
```

---

## Usage

The examples below use the standard package import form:

```typescript
import { bootstrapFramework, Services } from "pick-components";

await bootstrapFramework(Services);
```

### Presentational Component (Slot Projection)

Components that wrap child content in a styled layout using native Shadow DOM slots. No state, no logic.

```typescript
import { Pick } from "pick-components";

@Pick("card-container", (ctx) => {
  ctx.html(`
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-header">
        <slot name="header">Default Header</slot>
      </div>
      <div class="card-body">
        <slot>Default Content</slot>
      </div>
    </div>
  `);
})
export class CardContainer {}
```

```html
<card-container>
  <h2 slot="header">Card Title</h2>
  <p>Card body content goes here.</p>
</card-container>
```

---

### Data Display Component (Reactive Props)

Components that receive data via attributes and render it reactively.

```typescript
import { Pick } from "pick-components";

@Pick("user-badge", (ctx) => {
  ctx.props<{ name: string; role: string }>();

  ctx.html(`
    <div class="badge">
      <span class="name">{{name}}</span>
      <span class="role">{{role}}</span>
    </div>
  `);
})
export class UserBadge {}
```

```html
<user-badge name="Alice" role="Engineer"></user-badge>
```

---

### Interactive Component (Local State + Events)

Components with local state that responds to user interactions.

```typescript
import { Pick } from "pick-components";

@Pick("simple-counter", (ctx) => {
  ctx.state({ count: 0 });

  ctx.on({
    increment() {
      this.count++;
    },
    decrement() {
      this.count--;
    },
    reset() {
      this.count = 0;
    },
  });

  ctx.html(`
    <div class="counter">
      <pick-action action="decrement"><button type="button">−</button></pick-action>
      <span>{{count}}</span>
      <pick-action action="increment"><button type="button">+</button></pick-action>
      <pick-action action="reset"><button type="button">Reset</button></pick-action>
    </div>
  `);
})
export class SimpleCounter {}
```

---

### Class-Based Component (`@PickRender`)

For components that need async initialization or a lifecycle manager to wire external services.

```typescript
import {
  PickRender,
  PickComponent,
  PickInitializer,
  PickLifecycleManager,
  Reactive,
} from "pick-components";

class TodoInitializer extends PickInitializer<TodoList> {
  protected async onInitialize(component: TodoList): Promise<boolean> {
    component.items = await fetch("/api/todos").then((r) => r.json());
    return true;
  }
}

class TodoLifecycle extends PickLifecycleManager<TodoList> {
  protected onComponentReady(component: TodoList): void {
    this.addSubscription(
      todoService.onUpdate$.subscribe((items) => {
        component.items = items;
      }),
    );
  }
}

@PickRender({
  selector: "todo-list",
  template: `
    <ul>
      <pick-for items="{{items}}" key="id">
        <li class="{{$item.done ? 'done' : ''}}">{{$item.text}}</li>
      </pick-for>
    </ul>
  `,
  initializer: () => new TodoInitializer(),
  lifecycle: () => new TodoLifecycle(),
})
export class TodoList extends PickComponent {
  @Reactive items: Todo[] = [];
}
```

### Template Security

Pick Components validates static templates at compile time. Inline event handlers, executable elements, `srcdoc`, `style`, `srcset`, and unsafe URL protocols are rejected with explicit errors. Template expressions are evaluated through a constrained parser and dynamic URL bindings are checked by the attribute binding policy. Templates are developer-authored code, but they are still validated so templates remain declarative and do not become hidden JavaScript execution environments.

Manual verification: a template with `<img src="x" onerror="this.insertAdjacentHTML('afterend', '<strong id=xss-ok>ONERROR EJECUTADO</strong>')">` must fail rendering with a clear Pick Components error. `ONERROR EJECUTADO` must not appear.

---

## Component Intentions

Use `@Reactive` for state that renders. Use intent signals for one-shot user actions such as save, refresh, or mode change, which a lifecycle manager can coordinate with services.

```typescript
class ModeSelector extends PickComponent {
  @Reactive mode: RaceMode = "mass_start";

  readonly modeRequested$ = this.createIntent<RaceMode>();

  requestMode(mode: RaceMode): void {
    this.modeRequested$.notify(mode);
  }
}

class ModeSelectorLifecycle extends PickLifecycleManager<ModeSelector> {
  protected onComponentReady(component: ModeSelector): void {
    this.addSubscription(
      component.modeRequested$.subscribe((mode) => {
        raceService.setMode(mode);
      }),
    );
  }
}
```

`@Pick` has the same capability through `ctx.intent<T>("name$")`. Prefer this pattern for actions and commands; keep `getPropertyObservable()` for real state changes.

---

## View Actions

`<pick-action>` is the declarative bridge from view markup to component actions. It listens to click and keyboard activation on its child content, then dispatches a `pick-action` event that the nearest PickComponent handles.

```html
<pick-action action="archive" value="{{selectedId}}">
  <button type="button">Archive</button>
</pick-action>
```

- `action` is the action name exposed by `ctx.on(...)` or `getViewActions()`.
- `value` is optional and becomes the first action argument.
- The child can be any visual trigger, not only a `<button>`.
- `event` is also accepted as an alias for `action`, but new code should use `action`.
- Handled actions stop at the nearest component by default.
- Add `bubble` only when a parent component should be allowed to handle the same action.

## Interactive Playground

The project ships with 15 interactive examples that run in the browser via a TypeScript playground with live preview. Each example has an editable code panel (CodeMirror) and an iframe sandbox that re-transpiles and re-executes on every change.

Try it online: <https://pick-components.github.io/pick-components/>

### Running the playground

```bash
npm install
npm run build        # builds library + example bundles
npm run serve:dev    # http://localhost:3000
```

To preview the built examples with the production-oriented static server:

```bash
npm run build
npm run serve:dist   # http://localhost:8080
```

The playground also includes an edge worker template at `deploy/cloudflare/public-route-worker.mjs`. It serves prerendered public routes first, then falls back to the SPA shell for app-only paths. Crawler and browser requests receive the same canonical HTML; the client bundle only enhances it.
